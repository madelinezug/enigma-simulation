# enigma-simulation
A simulation of the enigma machine for Harvey Mudd's Cryptography class, Spring 2017

##Possible improvements
The enigma machine isn't super practical to use now that we have algorithms like RSA and AES.
However, if we wanted to improve the enigma machine and make it more difficult to crack we could:

1. Increase the number of rotors

2. Make the rotors behave in more complex ways, i.e. rotate in reverse, change directions after a certain number of rotations, rotate by different amounts

3. During WWII one of the reasons the enigma could be cracked was because of human errors in transmission. With modern computing we could automate the operation steps and key transmission/generation to eliminate these human errors.

4. My simulation didn't include extra settings like ring and plug settings that were available on the original enigma machine, and made it much harder to break. One way we could improve the machine or simulation would be to include additional settings.
