A simulation of the enigma machine for Harvey Mudd's Cryptography class

##Possible improvements
The enigma machine isn't super practical to use now that we have algorithms like RSA and AES.
However, if we wanted to improve the enigma machine and make it more difficult to crack messages enciphered by it we could:

1. Increase the number of rotors

2. Make the rotors behave in more complex ways, i.e. rotate in reverse, change directions after a certain number of rotations, rotate by different amounts

3. During WWII the main reason the enigma was cracked was because of human errors in transmission. With modern computing we could automate the operation steps and key transmission/generation to eliminate these human errors.
